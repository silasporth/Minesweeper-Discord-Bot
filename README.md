# Minesweeper-Discord-Bot
You can play Minesweeper at three difficulties with this bot. The game works sort of like the Google Version. So it's
pretty normal. You may realize that the game looks a bit different, but this was needed to make the game work. If you
encounter any sort of problem, open a new issue at my GitHub.

### General Command
``!minesweeper/!ms <control>``

### Controls
``play, end, flag, dig``
